Javascript 08 Operaators and Loops

What is an expression?

Expressions in js is any value of variable, operators, etc that evaluates a single value, like a number or string. There are two types of expressions. Ones that assign a value to a variable, and those that have a value.

x = 10 is an expression. Assigning x to the value of 7. Assigned operators. 

5 + 5 does not perform an assignment. Known as simply operators.

Arithmetic- Evaluates to a number
string- Evaluates to a character string
Logical- evaluates to a true or false


Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops allow devs to shorten what could be hundreds of lines of code to just a few. This allows them to write the code once and repeat it as many times as needed, making it more likely for the program to run as expected.

When does a for loop stop executing?

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.


How Many times will a while loop execute?

On its third pass

"With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:

After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
"
