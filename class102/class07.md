Programming with Javascript

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, (conditionals, loops)

What is a function?
Return statements are not required in functions but if you want to use then add.
funtion declaration / function definition of codes
function functionName(parameter) {code to execute goes here} 
Create a function before using it. Two seperate steps. 

if you want to return a function, you have to tell it what to return, "Return sum"
for example.
The return statement must be the last thing in the function.


What does it mean to invoke or call a function?


The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined.
The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.
It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".
A JavaScript function can be invoked without being called.

What is the importance of parenthese when invoking a function?

The functions wrapped with parenthesis are called â€œImmediately Invoked Function Expressions" or "Self Executing Functions.

The purpose of wrapping is to namespace and control the visibility of member functions. It wraps code inside a function scope and decrease clashing with other libraries.
