## Class 7 Readings: Object-oriented Programming, HTML Tables


**Domain Modeling**

1. Explain why we need domain modeling: It is a conceptual model in code that carries out important code structures that identifies concepts in a domain.


2. Why should Tables not be used for page layouts? Tables are meant for presentation and data. It is a hard maintain consistency and flow of the page can problems can arise. It also looks dated and ugly.

3. What is a constuctor and what are some advantages to using it?
"We use constructors to initialize the object with the default or initial state. The default values for primitives may not be what are you looking for.
Another reason to use constructor is that it informs about dependencies. In other words, using the constructor, we can request the user of that class for required dependencies.
We can find out what it needs in order to use this class, just by looking at the constructor." - JavaPoint.com 


4. How does the term “THIS” differ when used in an object literal vs when used in a constructor?
"this" for Objects, means when a change is made to an object, it can affect the entire script. The change for "this" wont affect the entire script when using constructors

5. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience:

There were five divisions in my department. Each divison had one LCPO(leading petty officer). Each division does fundamental tasks that we all do. I'll choose three 1. cleaning. 2. Inventory 3. Maintenance. But each division also has their own tasks. So we can all be grouped under certain tasks, but some divisions will have more or less tasks that vary in difficulty

In Javascript, this means you can have an object(1) cleaning, which can be grouped with function (2) Inventory, Funciton 3 can have Maintenance but no inventory, or maintenane and all of the above and then more tasks on top of those three. You can create your own objects and functions.
