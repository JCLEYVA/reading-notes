## Debugging

1. Name some key differences bewteen a syntax error and a logic error.
   
   "A syntax error occurs when we make a mistake in our coding, such as forgetting a semicolon to indicate the end of a statement. A logic error is harder to find. This occurs when we have all the correct syntax but we coded a portion of the program with an error, such as maybe, divide by zero" - javascript tutorial/linkedin.com

2. list a few types of errors that you have encountered in lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them:
 I constantly ran into issues of a value not being defined. I would identify the error in the console and, go to the line it references and I use a declaration statement to define it, such as const, let, var function, class ect. I'd also run into type errors and that usually occurs when you try to perform and operation value that is not of the expected type. Trying to call a function on a value that is the wrong type, for example. Use type checking to ensure you are using the correct variables. "typeof" operator and the "instanceof" operator.

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Debugging is critical, and basically our main job and its important that I get good at it so that I can be successful.


4. Define what a breakpoint is:
Breakpoints pause your code. If you need to investigate a specific region of your code, you can use various breakpoint types with certain conditions to pause your code.

5. What is the call stack?
"A JavaScript call stack is an example of a stack data structure. In a JS call stack, the elements are function invocations. Every time you invoke a function, it's added to the stack. If it has a nested function, that nested function will get added to the top of the stack as well, and so on." - Javascript Call Stacks. Builtin.com
