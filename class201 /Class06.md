## Class 6 readings: Problem domain, objects, and the DOM


**How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

Lumping or arranging a data structure of code to give values to properties. A good real world example is figuring out the pay, hour and salary of not just one employee but multiple. Each employee would be a variable and the object would be all three arranged into one. 

**2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?**
You can name object literals, and use the values from one function to another. For example, if you want a specific variable in one function, you can assign a value to that function and use the dot operator to refer to that specific variable. You create a container(object) you can have variables(properties) and functions (Members) .

**3. How do objects differ from arrays?**
Objects represent a data type that is mutable and used to store a container of data. Array is a variable that I mutable as well but can also be used to store a list of values.


**4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access and objects property instead of dot notation:** When an object property name is held in a variable.

**5. Evaluate the code. What does “this” term mean? What Is the advantage of “this” ?**
The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. 


**6. What is the DOM?** Document object model. A programming interface for HTML and XML documents.


**7.Describe the relationship between Dom and javascript.**
It represents the page in a tree structure so that programs can read, access and change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with JavaScript.
