Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flex box is a one-dimensional layout. It aligns the space among items in a gris container. This works with various screen sizes. This makes it easier to build responsive pages without using float position properties in the code. - simplilearn.com


Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
 Both axis decide how other properties (justifying and aligning) work. The main axis is horizontal, and the cross axis is vertical. It gives you all the tools you need in order to properly arrange content inside flexible containers. 

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
The row-reverse and column-reverse values reorder the visual display away from the order of the HTML document. 

CSS Layout - Flexbox


What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Instead of using a float to create layouts by floating elements to a certain space on the webpage, flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis. The axis can be horizontal or vertical. It allows for accesability, flow and distributing space for other items in the same axis.
