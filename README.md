**Growth mindset**

 Hello, My name is Jeanette and I am an 8 year military veteren.âš“These past 8 years have been challenging for me and having a fixed mindset has made it harder for me to be succesful. About midway through my career, I adapted a growth mindset to allow myself to overcome some challeges that have plagued me since middle school. I put myself in a box with a fixed mindset and stunted my growth. Adapting a growth mindset allowed me to rank up faster and have the confidence to lead people throughtout deployments and work ups. It is believing that you can become better overtime if you put in the work and self reflect on the areas that need improvement, holding yourself accountable, and talking to yourself in a postive manner.
