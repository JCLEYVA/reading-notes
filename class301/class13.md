## More CRUD

1. The HTTP method that is commonly used to update a record through an API is the HTTP PUT method. However, depending on the API and the use case, other methods such as PATCH or POST may also be used for updates.

2. The methods that typically require an ID parameter are PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods require the ID of the resource that needs to be updated, modified or deleted

3. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of basic operations that can be performed on data, typically through a database. REST, on the other hand, is an architectural style for building web services that use HTTP protocols to access and manipulate resources. RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are built using the CRUD operations, along with the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to perform those operations on resources.

4. To create a RESTful API, here are 5 steps:

   a.Define the resources and their endpoints: Identify the resources that the API will expose, and define the endpoints that will be used to access them. This can involve defining the URL structure, HTTP methods, and parameters for each endpoint.

   b. Implement the CRUD operations: Implement the necessary CRUD operations for each resource. This may involve writing code to handle GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests for each endpoint.

   c. Choose a data format: Choose a data format to use for the API's responses, such as JSON or XML. This format should be easy to parse and consume by user applications.

   d. Secure the API: Implement security measures to protect the API from unauthorized access or misuse. This may involve authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as API keys.

   e. Test and document the API: Test the API to ensure that it is functioning correctly and producing the expected results. Create documentation for the API that describes the available resources, endpoints, and parameters, along with examples of how to use them.
