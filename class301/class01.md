## Class 01 Introduction to React and Components

**What is a component?**
A component is a modular, reusable piece of code that represents a specific part of a user interface. Components can be thought of as building blocks that can be combined to create complex UIs.

**What are the characterisitcs of a component?**
Composability: A component should be able to be combined with other components to create larger, more complex UIs.
Flexibility: A component should be flexible enough to handle different use cases and be easily customizable.
Maintainability: A component should be easy to maintain, update, and modify over time.

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
Reusability: Components can be used across different parts of the application, which can help reduce development time and effort.
Scalability: Components can be easily combined to create complex UIs that can be scaled as needed.

**What is “props” short for?**
Props mean "properties"

**How are props used in React?**
props are used to pass data from one component to another. A parent component can pass props down to a child component, and the child component can use those props to render its own UI.

Props are passed to a component as an object, and can include any data that the component needs to render itself. For example, a parent component could pass a prop called "name" to a child component, and the child component could use that prop to display the name in its UI.

**What is the flow of props?**

Props flow in a unidirectional, top-down flow. This means that props are passed from parent components to child components, but not the other way around.

The flow of props can be visualized as a tree structure, with the parent component at the top and its child components below it. Props are passed down the tree from the parent to its immediate children, and then from those children to their own children.
