## Functional Programming


1. Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions to solve problems. 

2. A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input and does not have any side effects. We can check if a function is pure by checking if it always returns the same output for the same input.

3. The benefits of using pure functions include increased predictability, improved testability, and easier maintenance. 

4. Immutability is the concept of not allowing the modification of objects or data structures after they have been created.

5. Referential transparency is the property of a function that allows its output to be substituted with its return value without affecting the program's behavior.

6. A module is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates related functionality and can be imported and used in other programs.

7. In Node.js, the require() function is used to load and use modules. It takes the path to the module file as an argument and returns an object that represents the module's exports.

8. o bring another module into the file we are working in, we use the require() function to load the module and assign it to a variable.

9. To make a module available for use, we need to export its functionality using the module.exports object.
