## APIS

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

2. REST APIs are designed around a resource or a collection of resources.

3. An identifier of a resource is a unique string that represents that resource. An example of an identifier of a resource could be a URL https://example.com/api/users/1234, where "1234" is the identifier of the user resource.

4. The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. URIs should be based on the resources that they represent.

6. A good URI should be descriptive, easy to read, and follow a consistent naming convention: https://example.com/api/users/1234 is a good URI for retrieving information about a user with the identifier "1234".

7. Having a 'chatty' web API means that the API requires multiple requests to complete a single task. This is considered a bad thing as it can lead to increased latency and network traffic.

8. A successful GET request returns a status code of 200 (OK).

9. An unsuccessful GET request returns a status code of 404 (Not Found).

10. A successful POST request returns a status code of 201 (Created).

11. A successful DELETE request returns a status code of 204 (No Content).
