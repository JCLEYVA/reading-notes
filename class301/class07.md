What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?


Improved code quality, better collaboration and communication, enhanced learning and skill development, increased productivity, increased job satisfaction and morale, and reduced project risk.

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I find that improved collaboration and communication, enhanced learning and skill development, and improved code quality are some of the most significant benefits of pair programming.

How does pair programming work?
Pair programming involves two developers working together at one computer to jointly develop and test code. One person, known as the "driver," types code while the other person, known as the "navigator," provides guidance, feedback, and actively reviews the code being written. The two switch roles regularly, allowing for equal contributions and knowledge sharing. Pair programming can be done in person or remotely, using tools like screen sharing and collaborative coding environments.
