## Diversity in TECH


1.  During the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science, there was a significant shift in the perception of personal computers from being seen as toys or hobbyist gadgets to serious tools for work and productivity. This shift was largely driven by the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981, which helped to establish the personal computer as a standard tool in offices and homes. As personal computers became more prevalent and essential for work, they also became more associated with male-dominated fields like engineering and computer science. This, along with other factors such as the way that computer science was marketed to students, led to a decline in the number of women studying computer science and entering the field

2. It matters that males had been playing on computers growing up because early exposure and experience with computers can influence interest and confidence in pursuing computer science careers later in life. If more boys than girls had access to computers and were encouraged to explore and tinker with them from a young age, it could have contributed to the gender gap in computer science that we see today.

3. Diversity efforts are most successful when they are built into the fabric of a company's culture and values, rather than seen as a one-time HR box to be checked. Successful diversity efforts require commitment, accountability, and ongoing evaluation to ensure that they are making a meaningful impact.

4. Diverse companies perform better because they can bring a wider range of perspectives, ideas, and experiences to the table. This can lead to more innovation, creativity, and problem-solving, as well as better decision-making and risk management. Diverse teams are also better equipped to serve diverse user bases, as they can better understand and empathize with different needs and perspectives.

5. An example, a diverse company may be better equipped to design and market products that appeal to a wider range of consumers, including underrepresented groups. A diverse company may also be better equipped to identify and address biases or blind spots in their products and services, leading to better outcomes for all users. Conversely, a company that serves a diverse user base may benefit from having a diverse workforce that can better understand and respond to the needs of those users.
