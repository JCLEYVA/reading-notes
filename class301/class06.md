Who is Roy Fielding?
Roy Fielding is a computer scientist who played a key role in the development of the World Wide Web. He is known for his contributions to the creation of the HTTP protocol and the development of the REST architectural style.

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
The techniques that we use in JavaScript are designed for communication between a client and a server over the internet,  using a protocol like HTTP. However, when we need to be able to talk to all machines in the world, we need to take into account the different operating systems, network protocols, etc. In order to communicate with all machines in the world, we need to use more advanced technologies that are designed for that.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
The HTTP protocol is a set of rules for transferring data over the internet. HTTP defines a number of methods for interacting with web resources, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

What does a GET do?
A GET request is used to retrieve data from a web server. When a client sends a GET request to a server, the server responds with the requested data, in the form of an HTML page, image, or other resource.

What does a POST do?
A POST request is used to submit data to a web server. When a client sends a POST request to a server, the server processes the data in the request and returns a response. 

What does PUT do?
A PUT request is used to update an existing resource on a web server. When a client sends a PUT request to a server, the server replaces the existing resource with the new data provided in the request.

What does PATCH do?
A PATCH request is similar to a PUT request in that it is used to update an existing resource on a web server.
