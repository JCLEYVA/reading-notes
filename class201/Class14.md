What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? Trust, respectful communitcation and supportive leadership.


Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
I previously served in a division onboard the USS Stennis that struggled with psychological safety. The division LCPO was very authoritarian and often criticized our decisions and ideas without providing constructive feedback. This led to a culture in our division of fear and hesitation, and  reluctantcy to speak up or take initiative for fear of being reprimanded.

As a result, communication was ineffective and we struggled to work as a cohesive unit. We were not comfortable sharing our ideas or offering feedback, which limited the our ability to adapt and overcome challenges.

The lack of psychological safety made it difficult for us to trust one another, which undermined our ability to work as a team. There was a sense of individualism and competition rather than collaboration and mutual support.

The divisions performance suffered as a result of the lack of psychological safety. We were hesitant to take risks or try new approaches, and the division struggled to adapt to changing circumstances in the field. Our LCPOs focus on individual performance rather than team success further exacerbated the issue.

Overall, the lack of psychological safety had a significant impact on its effectiveness and success. Without a culture of trust, respect, and support, we were unable to meet deadlines during workups.

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Increased innovation and creativity, improved communication and collaboration, higher job satisfaction and retention,
Overall, teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety can lead to increased innovation, improved communication and collaboration, higher job satisfaction and retention, better problem-solving and decision-making. This can result in improved company performance, increased employee engagement, and a more positive work environment.
